**Watch** our [introduction video](https://aka.ms/tfonazure/vid/day4) to learn all about this #TerraformOnAzure coding challenge!

## Description

Now that we have our CI/CD pipeline setup for the team, it's time to pimp our web hosting to run on a Kubernetes cluster, specifically [Azure Kubernetes Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes?ocid=aid3015373_ThankYou_DevComm&eventId=HashiConfTerraformonAzure_JK1-K2-hoArJ) (AKS). AKS is a fully managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure, and reduces the complexity of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of the operational responsibility to Azure.

The first step to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster, is to create container image using the Docker CLI. How this container image is created is described in a **Dockerfile**.  The sample application already contains a preconfigured Dockerfile.

The next step is to publish this container image to a container repository, this could be **[Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro?ocid=aid3015373_ThankYou_DevComm&eventId=HashiConfTerraformonAzure_JK1-K2-hoArJ)** (ACR) or any other registry (e.g. Docker Hub).

You can find a [tutorial on how to publish a container image in ACR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-docker-cli?ocid=aid3015373_ThankYou_DevComm&eventId=HashiConfTerraformonAzure_JK1-K2-hoArJ) in our documentation site.

Finally, we need to describe how to deploy our application on a Kubernetes cluster. To do this, you can use the open-source [Helm packaging tool](https://helm.sh). You will find a Helm chart in the [sample application](https://github.com/Terraform-On-Azure-Workshop/AzureEats-Website) repo.

> **Note:** make sure to update the image repository in the ```values.yaml``` file of the Helm chart to match your container repository:

```yaml
image:
  repository: tailwindtradersacr.azurecr.io/web.api
  tag: prod
  pullPolicy: Always
```


## Success criteria üèÜ

To successfully complete this challenge, you will need to:

1. Use the Docker CLI to build a Docker image for the sample application and store it in a container registry
2. Use the Terraform CLI to provision an AKS cluster.
3. Deploy the [sample application](https://github.com/Terraform-On-Azure-Workshop/AzureEats-Website) on the AKS cluster using Helm

Spoiler: the [solution](./Solution.md) to this coding challenge is now available.
