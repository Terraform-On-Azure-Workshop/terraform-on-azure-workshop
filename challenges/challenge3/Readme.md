**Watch** our [introduction video](https://aka.ms/tfonazure/vid/day3) to learn all about this #TerraformOnAzure coding challenge!


## Description

So far, you have been working on your local developer machine to provision and deploy the application. In this third challenge, you will setup a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)**.

However, when running Terraform locally it also stores the current state of the infrastructure in a local file. When running a CI/CD pipeline, or when working in a team, you need to share the current state of the infrastructure. Terraform allows you to define remote state in a central location. In this challenge, you will configure the Terraform CLI to **[store the remote state in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/store-state-in-azure-storage?ocid=aid3015373_ThankYou_DevComm&eventId=HashiConfTerraformonAzure_JK1-K2-hoArJ)**.

Also, keep in mind that when you run Terraform locally, you typically authenticate interactively as a user to the Azure CLI. In a CI/CD pipeline, there is no interactive user session, so you will need to **[authenticate to Azure using a Service Principal](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/service_principal_client_secret.html)**.


## Success criteria üèÜ

To successfully complete this challenge, you will need to:

* Create an Azure Storage account to store the Terraform remote state
* Use the Terraform CLI to configure the remote state to use the remote state on Azure Storage
* Setup a Service Principal in Azure to allow non-interactive authentication
* Setup a CI/CD workflow in GitHub Actions that:
    * runs the Terraform CLI to provision the Azure infrastructure resources,
    * runs the Azure CLI to deploy the sample application to Azure App Service

Spoiler: the [solution](./Solution.md) to this coding challenge is now available.
