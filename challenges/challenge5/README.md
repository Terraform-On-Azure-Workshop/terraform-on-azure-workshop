# Challenge 5: connecting it all with Consul

**Watch** our [introduction video](https://aka.ms/tfonazure/vid/day5) to learn all about this #TerraformOnAzure coding challenge!

## Description

With our applications now running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), we want make sure that they can communicate with each other, while still staying secure.
In this final challenge, you will set up [Consul](https://www.consul.io) on your previously created AKS cluster using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io).
This will allow us to have mTLS encryption between all our services, and manage which services can communicate with each other.

You will then be able to create a Service Mesh that [spans](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/mesh-gateway) all of the AKS clusters of everyone participating.

## Success criteria üèÜ

To successfully complete this challenge, you will need to [deploy](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/installation/overview) a **single node Consul cluster** on your AKS cluster using the [Helm provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/helm/r/release.html) for Terraform.
The datacenter of the Consul cluster configuration must be named after your GitHub username.

The Consul cluster **must be federated with the primary datacenter**.
To [federate](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/wan-federation-via-mesh-gateways) the Consul clusters, you need to create a Kubernetes secret, containing all the needed configuration to federate Consul, from the `assets/consul-federation-secret.yaml` file that is provided with the challenge.

In order for the Mesh Gateways to reach each other, they need to be **exposed on a public IP**.
This can be done by [creating a static IP](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/public_ip.html) and a [Kubernetes service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip#create-a-service-using-the-static-ip-address) with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/r/service.html) that points at the selectors `app=consul` and `component=mesh-gateway`.

To check if your cluster has successfully joined the other clusters, you can run `consul members -wan` inside the consul-server-0 pod of your AKS cluster.
You should see a similar output as below, including `consul-server-0.<your datacenter>` and anyone else that has federated their cluster for this challenge.

Spoiler: the [solution](./Solution.md) to this coding challenge is now available.


```shell
/ # consul members -wan
Node                  Address           Status  Type    Build       Protocol  DC     Segment
consul-server-0.dc1   10.244.0.12:8302  alive   server  1.8.0beta2  2         dc1    <all>
consul-server-0.eveld 10.244.0.15:8302  alive   server  1.8.0beta2  2         eveld  <all>
```

For extra credit you can enable catalog [syncing](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/service-sync) between Kubernetes and Consul.
You should then see any Kubernetes services automatically sync into the Consul service catalog, e.g.

```shell
/ # consul catalog services
consul
mesh-gateway
```
